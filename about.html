            <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>
                My main goal in the HNG Internship is to sharpen my frontend development skills,
                learn best practices in real-world projects, and become confident in collaborative coding environments.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
                I sometimes struggle with debugging complex JavaScript logic, determining which css styles fit best
                based on the design at hand, and managing time when switching between multiple tasks,
                but I’m learning to improve through practice and consistency.

                Keep going, no matter how slow the progress feels. You’ve come so far, and you’ll go even farther
                if you stay focused, kind to yourself, and hungry to learn.

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I’m learning to trust the process — the small steps, the late nights, the mistakes.
                It’s all part of building something great.
